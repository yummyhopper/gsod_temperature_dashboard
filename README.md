# GSOD Dashboard with Looker Studio and BigQuery

### Overview

In this project I built a global temperature dashboard based on a public NOAA Google BigQuery Dataset using Google Looker Studio. This project was intended to build and display my ability with datawarehouse and business intelligence tools, not be a comprehensive study on climate change. I queried the database in BigQuery and then saved my work as views and tables which I then built visualizations off of in Looker Studio. The queries are stored in the BigQuery folder in this repository, and the Looker Studio dashboard is in a PDF in this repository.

### Data:

- Update Frequency: daily
- Source: NOAA
- Terms of use: This dataset is publicly available for anyone to use under the following terms provided by the Dataset Source — http://www.data.gov/privacy-policy#data_policy — and is provided "AS IS" without any warranty, express or implied, from Google.

- Description: When you think about the best storytellers of the 21st century, you might not think… data? But data analytics play an increasingly large role in how we interpret what’s happening around us and is indispensable in solving real-world problems. In this course, learn how to use Google Cloud BigQuery and Looker Studio to tell your data analytics stories. Instructor Yoyu Li provides a step-by-step demonstration of solving a real-world data analytics challenge, looking at global temperature changes over nine decades. Yoyu shares a full view of the process of telling a story with data, starting from a problem statement. She shows you how to use public datasets in BigQuery, how to run SQL queries, how to add data sources, and visualize data in Looker Studio. Yoyu starts each chapter with a problem to solve, so you can immediately see the concepts in action as go you along.
